# So You Think Ants Can Dance

This project is an implementation of a computer graphics assignment that animates characters using motion capture data. It demonstrates the use of transformations, scene graphs, and mocap data manipulation to create animated characters.

## Project Overview

In this project, I accomplished the following:

1. Implemented animated characters that perform continuous looping motions using mocap data.
2. Created characters that can transition seamlessly between a resting state and various action motions.
3. Designed more complex characters using transformed basic shapes (spheres, cubes, cones, cylinders) instead of simple stick figures.

## Key Features

- Skeleton-based character animation using CMU motion capture data
- Looping animations with smooth interpolation
- Dynamic motion switching with seamless transitions
- Custom character design using transformed basic shapes
- Interactive GUI for triggering different dance moves

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- WebGL
- GopherGfx (a custom graphics library)
- Node.js


## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained experience in:

- Composing transformations in a hierarchy to create a scene graph
- Using transformations to scale, rotate, and translate basic shapes into complex characters
- Manipulating mocap data to create different types of animations
- Creating looping animations with smooth interpolation
- Overlaying new motion clips onto characters at runtime
- Reading and extending sophisticated computer graphics code
